Hello! If you're wondering what all this weird stuff on your Kindle is,
I'm a usbnetwork hack! There's a good chance that I came from here:
http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004

I'm at version 0.32.N, so, if you wish to uninstall me, you'll at least need
the uninstaller from that version.

NOTE: Rename the 'DISABLED_auto' file to 'auto' if you want your Kindle to act
as Ethernet Over USB instead of Mass Storage USB by default.
Make sure you config is sane before doing this, though.
